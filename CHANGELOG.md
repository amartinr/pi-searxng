# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.4] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **LICENSE credits** — added `graelo` as a contributor for the home dir fix

### Fixed
- **Doubled `.pi/agent` path segment** — when `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is set, the
  config path was built as `.../.pi/.pi/agent/...` because the env var already
  points to the full agent directory (default: `~/.pi/agent`). The env var is
  now used as-is, with `~/.pi/agent` construction only as a fallback. Handles
  `~/`/`~\` and trailing-slash variants on Linux, macOS and Windows (PR #1,
  graelo)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- **`engines` field** — enforces Node.js >=18 at install time

### Fixed
- **Double body read in `search()`** — `res.json()` consumes the response
  stream internally; calling `res.text()` in the catch block then threw
  "Body is unusable". Fixed by reading the body once with `res.text()` and
  parsing with `JSON.parse()` manually
- **Config loaded on every search** — `loadConfig()` was called inside
  `search()` on each invocation in addition to the module-level call in
  `index.ts`. Fixed by passing the already-loaded `Config` object as a
  parameter to `search()`
- **Missing config log level** — absence of `config.json` logged as
  `console.warn`; downgraded to `console.info` since using defaults is
  the normal case

### Changed
- **`limit` included in cache key** — cache ID is now an MD5 hash of
  `query|limit` when a limit is provided, so the same query with different
  limits gets independent cache entries
- **`limit` parameter sanitized** — non-integer or sub-1 values are
  rounded up to the nearest integer; a note is included in the response
  when the value was adjusted
- **Removed 50-result hard cap** — results are now only capped by
  `maxResults` from config and SearXNG's own limits

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- **Restructured for npm publishing** — source moved to `src/`, compiled output to `dist/`
- **Removed legacy root TypeScript files** — clean project layout

### Added
- **Deterministic cache IDs** — MD5 hash of query enables cache deduplication and `get_search_results` lookups
- **Configurable safesearch** — `"off"`, `"moderate"`, `"strict"` mapped to SearXNG's `0/1/2`
- **Cache with TTL and LRU eviction** — freshness TTL (15 min), access TTL (24h), max 200 entries
- **Configurable cache settings** — `cacheFreshnessMs`, `cacheTtlMs`, `cacheMaxSize` in config
- **Cache config fields** — all cache parameters tunable via `config.json`

### Fixed
- **Error handling** — malformed JSON and non-OK responses now produce descriptive errors with URL and body
- **Config validation** — field type checks with `console.warn` on invalid values, `console.error` on corrupt JSON
- **Config path** — robust `resolveHomeDir()` with `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `HOME`, `homedir()` fallbacks
- **URL field mapping** — fallback to `url_normalized` when `r.url` is missing
- **Consistent response shape** — `details` field present in both success and error paths for both tools
- **Cache eviction** — LRU ordering instead of FIFO for correct least-recently-used behavior
- **Publish config** — `files` restricted to `dist/`, `pi.extensions` points to compiled JS

### Removed
- **`fetch_content` tool** — out of scope for this SearXNG-only search plugin
- **GitHub repo cloning** — no longer attempts to clone repositories from search results

### Chores
- Added `package-lock.json` to `.gitignore`
- Corrected authorship and repository URL
- Normalized `repository.url` to `git+https` format

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Initial fork of [jcha0713/pi-searxng](https://github.com/jcha0713/pi-searxng)
- `web_search` tool — search the web via SearXNG
- `get_search_results` tool — retrieve cached search results by ID
- Basic in-memory search cache
